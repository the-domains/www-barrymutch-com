Hey guys,

Please do support one of the only great interviewers left on the planet and support Jeff Wood's great new entry into the world of Rock & Roll writing.

Just got my copy a few days ago and this is pretty entertaining indeed.

This guy is just about one of the few people I'd ever bother to let interview me. All substance and no TMZ.

Respect Dr. J.
