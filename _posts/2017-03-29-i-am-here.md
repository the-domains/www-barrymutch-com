# Unity - The Debut Solo Album

I am here...Switzerland. A place I never pictured being.

I came for many reasons.

Peace..Personal and social.

A chance to re-align with what I saw important and critical to living happily, aware, and capable in the world we live in.

I came here to change. To grow. To become a phoenix from the flame of my past.

I came here to primarily to focus on the amazing chance to record my first solo debut album, which has, in essence, been a lifetime in the making under the amazing freedom provided by some of the many attributes of Switzerland I greatly appreciate and and proud to be here.

All around me in every direction is a different culture, ideals and ideologies. So strange for a kid growing up in a country with arguably 2 borders.

I have come a long way to a peaceful place and I have brought with me, through great trials and tribulations , the tools of the trade, the teeth, the means to almost completely create this album.

I have had some wonderful and unexpected help along the way. The great generosity of of wonderful people have made it possible for m to to get here, be here, and have the studio space full of soul and heart in which to live this dream.

Without this this project wouldn't be impossible, but it would be a game of inches not yards, not miles.

It takes an enormous amount of time, technology, equipment, production and engineering knowledge, combined with a great support team of people that care and give the same passion you give to make it a reality.

In essence, a huge amount of persistence to achieve these artistic efforts and surrounded by good people.

I would be greatly honored if you would be someone who would show your belief in the project by helping continue to support it's making.

By showing your belief and support in this musical and artistic endevour by pre-purchasing your digital copy you will be being a part of fulfilling a dream of sounds a lifetime in the making and allowing me to continue the human need to connect in Unity through song.

I have written many types of songs for other artists.

I have produced and engineered songs for other artists but I have never sat down and put together a message from me to this volatile and frail world that speaks from my own heart directly.

At this point in my life, I have a build up, both musically and lyrically, that needs a place beyond my thoughts and private moments

I hope that you will find it in yourself to take the time and financial generosity to help make this project become a reality.

i can promise it will be made with soul, truth, and everything i have inside me waiting to express.

i do hope it speaks to you. In done way.

Thst is the point of any language.

Music most of all

To connect.

I ask only a trade for a trade. I don't believe in donations. I believe in reciprocation.

I have three levels of pledges of support and each of them are different.

* You can simply purchase and support a digital very high quality download package including lyrics, artwork and the making of the album in HD.
* You can purchase the album the way it is truly intended for audiophiles or collectors, including not only the above but a heavy weight 180 gram double vinyl album produced in Paris, the new land of extreme audiophile vinyl.
* Simply and most importantly a patron of the arts pledge that included both the digital download, the double heavyweight vinyl recording, and you or your companies name included, indelibly, in the credits for the album as an appreciation of your incredibly generous support in making a project of this magnitude a reality.

I promise you the best of me.

I promise you honesty.

I promise you every inch of my soul.

The warmest wishes and regards,
