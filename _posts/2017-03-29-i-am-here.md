I am here...Switzerland....For one purpose.

To record my debut album a lifetime in the making.

I have come a long way to a peaceful place and I have brought with me, through great trials and tribulations , the tools of the trade, the teeth, do. to speak to make it happen.

I am asking for those of you that believe in the arts for something that I believe is an equal trade at best.

In exchange for 13 CHF i promise to deliver to you 13 songs recorded st the highest quality and chosen from a lifetime of songwriting, songs that I believe sit well together and deliver a message that is much needed right now.

Songs of hope and unity.

I have written many types of songs for other artists.

I have produced and engineered songs for other artists but I have never sat down and out together a message from me to this volatile and frail world that speaks from my own heart directly.

I hope that you will find it in yourself to take a small risk and see if what I have to share is worth considering.

i wish for connection. For commonality. For understanding. 

Maybe not total peace but a little love.
