# Unity - The Debut Solo Album

I am here...Switzerland.

I came for many reasons. 

Peace..Personal and social. 

A chance to re-align with what I saw important and critical to living happily, aware, and capable in the world we live in.

I came here to primarily to focus on the amazing chance to record my first solo debut album, which has, in essence, been a lifetime in the making under the amazing freedom provided by some of the many attributes of Switzerland I greatly appreciate and and proud to be here.

All around me in every direction is a different culture, ideals and ideologies. So strange for a kid growing up in a country with arguably 2 borders.

I have come a long way to a peaceful place and I have brought with me, through great trials and tribulations , the tools of the trade, the teeth, the means to almost completely create this album.

It takes an enormous amount of time, technology, equipment, production and engineering knowledge, combined with a great support team and a huge amount of persistence to achieve these artistic efforts.

I would be greatly honored if you would be someone who would show your belief in the project by helping continue to support it's making.

By showing your belief and support in this musical and artistic endevour by pre-purchasing your digital copy you will be being a part of fulfilling a dream of sounds a lifetime in the making and allowing me to continue the human need to connect in Unity through song.

I have written many types of songs for other artists.

I have produced and engineered songs for other artists but I have never sat down and out together a message from me to this volatile and frail world that speaks from my own heart directly.

At this point in my life, I have a build up, both musically and lyrically, that needs a place beyond my thoughts and private moments 

I hope that you will find it in yourself to take the time and financial generosity to help make this project become a reality.

i can promise it will be made with soul, truth, and everything i have inside me waiting to express. [Please click here to show your support and pre-purchase your copy today.][0]
